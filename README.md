**Inventory Management System (IMS)**

This Python-based console application is designed to efficiently manage inventory for small businesses. The IMS allows users to:

* **Create and manage products:** Add, edit, and delete product information, including product ID, name, category, price, and stock quantity.
* **Track inventory levels:** Monitor stock levels and receive low-stock alerts to ensure timely replenishment.
* **Search and filter products:** Quickly locate specific products based on name, category, or stock levels.
* **Handle inventory adjustments:** Make adjustments to stock quantities to reflect sales, returns, or restocks.

**Key Features:**

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Leverages OOP concepts to model products and inventory operations, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
* **Data Structures:** Employs lists and dictionaries to store and manage product information effectively.
* **Error Handling:** Incorporates error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected program termination and provide informative error messages.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a simple and intuitive console-based interface for easy interaction.

**Learning Opportunities:**

This project provides a hands-on learning experience in:

* **Python programming:** Reinforces core Python concepts, including data structures, control flow, and functions.
* **OOP principles:** Applies OOP principles to design and implement a modular and scalable inventory system.
* **Problem-solving and logical thinking:** Develops problem-solving skills by breaking down complex inventory management tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
* **Software development best practices:** Adheres to best practices for code readability, maintainability, and error handling.

By working on this project, you can gain valuable practical experience in inventory management and software development, laying the foundation for more advanced projects.
